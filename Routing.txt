STATIC Router Connection

Cables : PC-Switch => Copper Straight through in Fast Ethernet
	 Switch-Router => Copper Straight through in Gigabit Ethernet
	 Router-Router => Serial DTE in Serial

Router adding:
	Add an external cover named -2T for using serial connection.
	To add the cover click the router and physical tab, there in modules click -2T cover.
	Before adding cover turn off the Router and add, the turn it back on.


Connect the end devices to the switch:
	Connect the end devices with switch by assigning Ip address for them.
	All with same domain:
	192.168.1.10	192.168.1.11	192.168.1.12	…

Configure router for the switch:
	Set the IP address for the switch network (i.e) Default gateway in Interface, Gigabit Ethernet Ip configuration.
	Give the last no as .1
	ex 192.168.1.1
	Turn on the port.

~Test the connection if the packet sends within the network

Configure router for the router:
	Set the IP address for the serial in Router, Interface, Static and give an IP address
	It as 2 parts which is FROM and TO
	TO IP from router 1 is given as FROM IP in router 2
	i.e Router 1 has only configured with one serial which is 0 for outgoing.
	    That address is given as serial 0 in Router 2, Same as that for all others.
	    By the way, the last router too have only 1 serial port which is 0.
	And turn on the port.

Configure the routes in Router:
	~In Router, Routing, Static set Ip address.
	1. Set for next gateway from which path.
		ex To 10.10.10.0 go by 11.0.0.3
		ex To 172.16.1.0 go by 11.0.0.3
		ex To 14.8.1.0 go by 11.0.0.3
		
		The way to access other gateway are same because of only one path is available which is 11.0.0.3 of serial 1. 
		Next gateway should be end with .0 of the default gateway.

	2. Set the redirect address for next route by giving the serial IP Address.
		Given like To access the next networks, Go by this way.
		ex To access next networks connected with 12.0.0.0 go by 11.0.0.3
		Here 11.0.0.3 is the serial 1 of router 1.
		12.0.0.0 is the next gateways all address. 
		To specify the all other device, we give the address as .0

DYNAMIC Router Connection

All the steps are same till configuring router. 
The part is giving IP address Dynamically...…
So for that we have to give in RIP - Routing Information Protocol

Given the address of the serial like 11.0.0.0 only .0 for specifying all devices.
Given the address of next gateways like 10.10.10.0 only .0
Give the address of the same gateway also.
